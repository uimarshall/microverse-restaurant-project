# This Project is Restaurant app build using JavaScript to render the page. It is a simple restaurant page with 3 pages.


> In this project, i built a `Restaurant` app following the [OdinProject](https://www.notion.so/Lifestyle-articles-b82a5f10122b4cec924cd5d4a6cf7561) specification.<br>


## Project Description

The project is initialized by running `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev` to install webpack to the node_modules directory of your project.
A `src and dist` is created in the directory with the following contents:
- index.js file in src.
- index.html file in dist. 
- main.js is by generated by webpack when you run `npm run build`.
- A `webpack.config.js` is created to do the basic configurations.
- An HTML skeleton inside of `dist/index.html` file.

Bare-bones homepage is created for a restaurant. with the Inclusion an image, headline, and some copy about how wonderful the restaurant is. The html is then removed  and instead created by using JavaScript only. 
The code is modularised with different functions and imported and call it inside of index.js. to run the application.

Next, was to set up the restaurant site to use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages. 
The project is hosted on gh-pages.
